hugging face and prompt engineer/vibecode enthuasist here.

futures calculator is running on html and javascript, basic javascript.
javascript is using coingecko's api and also factored in the rate limiting of 30 calls/hour as we will bump into errors due to the constant calling using the free plan
the calculation could use alittle help and will experiment around to get the correct formula.

future plans
will introduce volatility, implied and realized for the future purpose to forecast.

future future plans (highly unlikely)
introduced more conditions coupled with machine learning to forecast volatility based on market sentiment.
1) trump's tweets
2) breaking news relating to geopolitical events
using machine learning to target certain events we have the possibility of marking out volatility but market is always priced in regarding this, but then again it's good information and could be used to pinpoint for certain events.
thanks
